# SD Card Creation Tool for Linux

This tool is used for creating a bootable SD card for the RZ/G2L-SBC board in a Linux environment.

## Step 1: Identify the SD Card Slot

1. Insert your SD card into the Linux PC.
2. Use the following command to identify the correct device name for your SD card

```bash
lsblk
```

## Step 2: Flash the SD Card
1. Ensure the sd_flash.sh script is executable.
```
chmod +x sd_flash.sh
```
2. Run the sd_flash.sh script with the SD card device name. Optionally, you can include the filesystem tarball image path as a second argument
```
./sd_flash.sh <device> <path/to/your/core-image.tar.bz2>
```

**Note:**
- **device**: The path to your SD card device, identified in Step 2 (e.g., `/dev/sda`).
- **path/to/your/core-image.tar.bz2**: The path to the directory containing the root filesystem tarball image. If no `core-image.tar.bz2` location is passed, the default path is set to `renesas-core-image-weston-rzg2l-sbc.tar.bz2` inside any release package).

3. Example run

Without passing the filesystem tarball path as an argument:

```
./sd_flash.sh /dev/sda
```

Passing the filesystem tarball path as an argument:

```
./sd_flash.sh /dev/sda /home/renesas/rz-sbc/images/renesas-core-image-weston-rzg2l-sbc.tar.bz2
```

The above command is an example for the root filesystem tarball image `renesas-core-image-weston-rzg2l-sbc.tar.bz2` when building with the target image `IMAGE=renesas-core-image-weston`. Other target images will have the same format but with names corresponding to their respective target images.

After successfully executing the SD card flashing script, the SD card will be automatically unmounted.
