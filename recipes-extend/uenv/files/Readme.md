# How to configure the environment variables in uEnv.txt

It is possible to set U-Boot environment variables in uEnv.txt file.
You can set U-Boot environment variables in the uEnv.txt file, which is located on the FAT32 partition (in partition 1). Modify this file to match your U-Boot environment settings.
To load the devicetree overlay file from "overlays/" folder, you should set "enable_overlay_".
Also you can set some environment variables from U-Boot to overwrite the old settings.

Refer to the following description for different loading options.


## For RZ SBC U-Boot Env
| Config                    | Value if set | To be loading       |
|---------------------------|--------------|---------------------|
| `enable_overlay_i2c`      | '1' or 'yes' | rzg2l-sbc-ext-i2c.dtbo   |
| `enable_overlay_spi`      | '1' or 'yes' | rzg2l-sbc-ext-spi.dtbo   |
| `enable_overlay_can`      | '1' or 'yes' | rzg2l-sbc-can.dtbo       |
| `enable_overlay_dsi`      | '1' or 'yes' | rzg2l-sbc-dsi.dtbo       |
| `enable_overlay_csi_ov5640` | '1' or 'yes' | rzg2l-sbc-ov5640.dtbo    |

**Note:**

*   `fdtfile`: This is the base device tree blob (DTB) file. It should typically be set to `rzg2l-sbc.dtb`.
*   `uboot env`: You can set other U-Boot environment variables here, such as `console=` or `bootargs=`.
